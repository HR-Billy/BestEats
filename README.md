This project was a brief 1-week sprint where our team completed an MVP for an external client, BestEats, a one-stop grocery shop for working adults and young families. This website is designed to assist those with little to no time to shop for groceries find a quick alternative. Aside from grocery shopping this website offers meal plans, nutrition tracking, avenue to local farmers, and more.
